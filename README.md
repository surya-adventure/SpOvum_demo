# SpOvum_demo

Parse the information and visualize the data:

Unzip/extract the 7Z folder (available at jobs.spovum.com/Data_interview.2030.7z)

* The data contains 3 folders, each folder having one file named DM_values.txt

* The folder name is prefixed with a date of the format yyyymmdd (20301110 => 2030 Nov 10)

* The file DM_values.txt has data in 2 columns - colA and colB

Extract the 2 columns from the DM_values files (skip empty lines) using Python (how quickly can you piece together something in a new language?!) and insert it into a table with the following columns:

Sno, folderName, date, fileName, colA, colB

1, 20301112_8_20301112_23, 20301110,  8, 2

2, 20301110_8_20301112_23, 20301110, 7, 1

.

.

Plot the data using PHP and D3 (or a visualization library of your choice)

colA VS sno (horizontal axis)

colB VS sno (horizontal axis)

Average(colA) VS date

Average(colB) VS date

We will be forced to not consider incomplete/ irreproducible codes (as you might have guessed it).
